# Crop-Recommendation-System

[Link To The App](https://crops-recommendation-system.herokuapp.com/)

### The motivation behind this project

Conventional agriculture causes increased greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, water pollution and wastage.
It affects Farmers negatively as well 


### Agenda 
To tackle these issues we use precision farming approach and recommend optimum crops to be cultivated by farmers based on several parameters and help them make an informed decision before cultivation  


### What is Precision Farming ?

Precision farming is an approach where inputs are utilised in precise amounts to get increased average yields


### Project Timeline

* Performed EDA on the dataset
* Tested different machine learning algorithms to find the most optimal one
* We selected Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier as it gave highest accuracy, precision and recall with training as well as test datasets
* Built a client facing API using Flask
